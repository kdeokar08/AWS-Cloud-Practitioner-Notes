AWS is responsible for security of the cloud.
  Physical security of data centers
  Hardware and software infrastructure
  Network infrastructure
  Virtualization infrastructure

Access control in a granular way by using the AWS service, AWS Identity and Access Management, or IAM. 

#### Root user
- email id password signin. that has complete access to all AWS services and resources in the account. 
- two set of credentials - 1. email id-password 2. access key ID: for example, A2lAl5EXAMPLE & secret access key: for example, wJalrFE/KbEKxE.

#### IAM Users
IAM Users are created. By default an IAM user has no permissions. They are given certain specific permissions.

After users are created they are assigned IAM policy.
![AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner/policy.png](/resource/policy.png)
#### IAM policy 
is a JSON document that describes what API calls a user can or cannot make.
> Effect : Allow/deny
> Action : api call.
> Resource: resource regarding the api call.(like a bucket name or something)

#### IAM groups. 
  ```
  Easier to manage users & their permissions.
  Attach a policy to a group and all of the users in that group will have those permissions.
  ```
#### IAM Roles 
  ```
  Identities in AWS that are called roles. 
  Have associated permissions that allow or deny specific actions. These can be assumed for temporary amounts of time.
  When a role is assigned, it abandons all of the previous permissions that it has and it assumes the permissions of that role.
  An IAM role is an identity that you can assume to gain temporary access to permissions.  
  ```

#### AWS Organizations. 
  ```
  Install order and to enforce who is allowed to perform certain functions in what account is to make use of an AWS services. 
  Manage all accounts centrally.
  Hierarchical groupings of your accounts to meet security, compliance, or budgetary needs.-> organizational units (OUs) 
  Centrally permission control by using service control policies (SCPs)
  ```

### AWS Artifact
  ```
  Every industry has some specific standards that need to be upheld, 
  and you will be audited or inspected to ensure that you have met those standards.
  example:  If you run healthcare applications in the US you will need to design your architectures to meet HIPAA. 
  Service which provides access to the security and compliance reports and select online agreement.

  AWS Artifact Agreements: sign agreement with AWS regarding usage of certain type of information throughout AWS Services. You can review, accept, and manage agreements for an individual account and for all your accounts in AWS Organizations
  AWS Artifact Reports provide compliance reports from third-party auditors. 
  ```

We have security groups and network access layer which by default protect us from ddos attacks.
elb is also scalable and wouldn't be prone to slowloris attach
aws shield.

### AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS)
    To encrypt data at rest or in transit, keys are offered.

### AWS Web Application Firewall 
  Monitor requests than come to your web applications.
  it's works with cloud front and load balancer. it's like a network access list but for the web applications.

### Amazon Inspector
    helps in improving security and compliance of applications by running automated security assessments.
    checks for security vulnerabilities and deviation from the best practices - eg: open access to ec2 instances and installation vulnerabilities.
    provides with the list of security findings. 
    it includes severity level, including detailed description of each security issue and a recommentation how to fix it. 
 

### Amazon GuardDuty
    analyzes continuous streams of metadata generated from your account, network activity found on aws cloud trail events.
    amazon vpc logs, dns logs. 
    uses integrated threat intelligence, known as malicious ip, anomaly detection, machine learning to identify threats more accurately.
    it runs independent from your other aws services.

### IAM Credential Report.
- report that lists all users in your account and the status of their various credentials, including passwords, access keys, and MFA devices.
- You can use credential reports to assist in your auditing and compliance efforts.

### IAM Access Analyzer.
- identify the resources in your organization and accounts, shared with an external entity.
- identify unintended access to your resources and data - which is a security risk.
- for instance of resource shared outside of the account, iam generates a finding
