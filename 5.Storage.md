### Instance stores
- Block-level storage volumes behave like physical hard drives. 
- An instance store is disk storage that is physically attached to the host computer for an EC2 instance,
and therefore has the same lifespan as the instance. When the instance is terminated, you lose any data in the instance store.

### Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) 
- mission critical, i/o intensive
- Is a service that provides block-level storage volumes that you can use with.
- To create an EBS volume, you define the configuration (such as volume size and type) and provision it. 
- After you create an EBS volume, it can attach to an Amazon EC2 instance.
- You can take incremental backups of EBS volumes by creating Amazon EBS snapshots.


### S3
- Data is stored as objects. It can be anything. It's stored in a bucket.
- Versioning of objects is supported. max object size 5tbs.
- These buckets can be put in different tiers.
    
#### Some notable tiers.
- S3 Standard - 11 9's of durability - of chance of remanining intact for 1 year.
  - data is stored in 3 different facilities.
- S3 Standard Infrequent Access or  S3 Standard-IA
               - Data that is accessed less frequently but requires rapid access when needed.
               - data is stored in 3 different facilities.
- S3 One Zone Standard Infrequent Access 
               - same as above but data is stored only in a single zone.
- S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval
               - Retain data for several years for auditing purposes. No need of being retrieved very rapidly. 
- S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval
- S3 Glacier Deep Archive
- S3 Intelligent Tiering
   - For example, say we need to keep an object in S3 Standard for 90 days, and then we want to move it to S3 Standard-IA for the next 30 days.
    Then after 120 days total, we want to move it to S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval
- AWS S3 Outposts 
      store data durably on your outposts.

- EFS
  Scalable, replication enabled file system.
  Amazon EFS can have multiple instances reading and writing from it at the same time.
  
  Amazon EBS volumes attach to EC2 instances and are an Availability Zone-level resource. Hence EBS stores data in single availability zone.
  In order to attach EC2 to EBS, you need to be in the same AZ. Not scalable. 

Amazon Fsx
 scalable high-performance file systems in the cloud.
 Lustre, NetApp ONTAP, OpenZFS, and Windows File Server.
 
Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS)
  DB Engine's supported:
    Amazon Aurora
    PostgreSQL
    MySQL
    MariaDB
    Oracle Database
    Microsoft SQL Server

    AWS provides AWS Aurora

Amazon Dynamo DB - nosql db
    Serverless database.
    Data is organized into items, and items have attributes.
    Auto-Scalable, available across multiple az's/

Redshift - data warehousing
    Analysis on exabytes of data.


Amazon Database Migration Service
  Why: Migration of your database from on-prem to cloud.
  The best part is that the source database remains fully operational during the migration

  Homogeneous data migrations - are easy.
  Heterogeneous - schema conversion tool is used. then DMS is used.
  Data consolidation - multiple databases to consolidate into one central database.

Amazon document db - mongodb. AWS Service
Neptune - graph db - social webs
Amazon managed blockchain - decentralization component. so not good for financial institutions where data is spread across.
Quantum Ledger DB - immutable ledger db 

Adding caching layers on top of your databases = improve read times from mil sec to microsec.
Amazon ElastiCache can provide those caching layers without your team needing to worry about the heavy lifting of launching, uplift, and maintenance. 
And it comes in both Memcached and Redis flavors.
