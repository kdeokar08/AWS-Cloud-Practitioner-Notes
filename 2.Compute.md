Compute
  EC2 - Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud.
    The service you use to gain access to virtual servers is called EC2.
    Pay for what you use. Because with EC2, you only pay for running instances, not stopped or terminated instances. 
    EC2 runs on top of physical host machines managed by AWS using virtualization technology. 
    When you spin up an EC2 instance, you aren't necessarily taking an entire host to yourself. 
    Instead, you are sharing the host with multiple other instances, otherwise known as virtual machines. 
    And a hypervisor running on the host machine is responsible for sharing the underlying physical resources between the virtual machines. 
    This idea of sharing underlying hardware is called multitenancy. 

  To create an EC2 instance - define the following
    Hardware specifications: CPU, memory, network, and storage bullet
    Logical configurations: Networking location, firewall rules, authentication, and the operating system of your choice

  Before creating an EC2 first setting that is choosing the operating system by choosing the AMI.
  AMIs can be choosen from AWS itself, marketplace, custom one created by user, Community.

  Amazon EC2 instance types - decoding names
    c5n.xlarge
    c - instance type (compute)
    5 - generation
    n - attribute
    xlarge - size.
    
  

  EC2 - Instance Types
    General purpose, Compute optimized, Memory optimized, Accelerated computing, and Storage optimized.
    General - good balance of compute, memory, network, storage. Usage - web services / code repositories.
    Compute - compute intensive tasks, gaming, scientific modelling, high performance computing(HPC)
    Memory - memory optimized instances are good for memory-intensive tasks. 
    Accelerated computing - for floating point number calculations, graphics processing, or data pattern matching, as they use hardware accelerators
    Storage optimized - high performance for locally stored data.

### EC2 Instances Pricing:

**On-Demand Instances** are ideal for short-term, irregular workloads that cannot be interrupted. 
  
**Reserved Instances**: billing discount applied to the use of On-Demand instances in your account due to committment of usage for 1 or 3 year period.
  
  > Standard: if ec2 instance type and size is known.

  > Convertible Reserved Instances: To run your EC2 instances in different Availability Zones or different instance types

**Savings**: discount when hourly committments are made for a period of 1/3 years.

**Spot**: Random instances.. 90% off.

**Dedicated** Most expensive.

### Scaling: 
> Desired, minimum running and maximum running.


## Elastic Load Balancing
Managed services. Runs at a region level. 

Because ELB is regional, it's a single URL that each front end instance uses. Then the ELB directs traffic to the back end that has the least outstanding requests. Now, if the back end scales, once the new instance is ready, it just tells the ELB that it can take traffic, and it gets to work. The front end doesn't know and doesn't care how many back end instances are running. This is true decoupled architecture.

## Messaging and Queuing

#### Amazon Simple Queue Service or SQS
Send, store, and receive messages between software components at any volume. These scale automatically, are reliable, and are easy to configure and use. 

#### Amazon Simple Notification Service or SNS
messaging + notifications.
creation of topics and publish message on the topic and the subscribers of that topic will get the message.


### AWS Lambda
AWS Lambda is one serverless compute option. 
upload your code into a Lambda function. 
Scalable. Designed for code to execute under 15 minutes.

If access to underlying env is needed but still want efficiency and portability -> container services. 
> AWS Elastic Container Services.
> AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service.

ECS / EKS is run on top of EC2. if you don't want to manager underlying ec2 instance, AWS fargate can manage that for you.
